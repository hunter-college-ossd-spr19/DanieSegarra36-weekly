### Academic Background

Hello! My name is Daniel Segarra and I'm a senior, studying computer science, at Hunter College.  
I stumbled onto computer science by mere chance during my freshman year. Forced by Hunter's ambassadors, at my freshman orientation, I picked a schedule block that happened to have CSCI 120. I figured it wouldn't hurt, since I could just use the course for Hunter's science requirement.

Despite the fact that the course was just an intro to basic computer knowledge (_i.e. computer parts, the internet, etc_), I was still very intrigued. My curiosity encouraged me to try another class the following semester and another the semester after. After recognizing and acknowledging the amount of interest I was showing, both in and out of class, I decided to take part in the computer science major. I was never too keen on forcing myself to like something so this was a big deal and rather surprising, in a good way, to me.

Since then, I have a learned a ton and hope to learn even more both in the time I have left in college and afterwards, beyond formal education.

### Fun(?) Facts!

Hobbies of mine include, but are not limited to, reading, running, music, and learning new things.
