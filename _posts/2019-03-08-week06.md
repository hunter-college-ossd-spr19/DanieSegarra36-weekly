## [A Crash Course in Open Source Licensing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cJIi-hIlCQM&feature=youtu.be)

Copyright is the right to control distribution of copies of your original work
Work can be “reproduced” for discussion purposes (e.g. rewriting to facilitate discussion/review)
You cannot make physical copies (i.e. existing in completion in more than one location without consent)
“Mental” copy is allowed (i.e. seeing and remembering/recalling the source; note this is not a physical copy. This is the equivalent of singing or discussing a verse of a song. It is considered “fair use” for the purpose stated and not for commercial use.)
If you attain a physical copy and have no intentions of using it you have still violated copyright law. You cannot give it to another party either, that is a violation as well. This still applies even if the original creator has given you this copy. You are, however, allowed to execute it privately but not publicly (e.g. a public demonstration to other parties). Though being copied into computer memory counts as a copy, the purpose of software is to be executed on a computer and court cases have deemed execution of copyrighted code to be okay.
Remember no license implies that all legal rights of the original content are reserved to the creator of the content

Personally I thought the video was great!
