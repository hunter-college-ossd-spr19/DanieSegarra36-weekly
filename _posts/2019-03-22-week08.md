### Assignments

1. Patrick Masson's presentation was packed with information and advice. We are fortunate that he has made these slides available for review. Reread the slides, with a focus on two ideas:

- communities of practice in open source software development and how they differ from traditional in-house development practices
- the maturity model  
  We will discuss these ideas again on Friday, March 22.

2. Back to licenses. There is more that you need to understand about licenses, and Tom Callaway has a good presentation about it on YouTube, [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PTYuDrQpyH0). Watch (and listen to) this video before Tuesday's class on March 19.
3. In your weekly blog, write a detailed progress report on what you did this week on your group project. Have you narrowed down issues, where do you stand in terms of understanding the code, have you made contact with the community at all?
