## [Personalities and Inclusivity in Open Source](https://opensource.com/open-organization/18/11/design-communities-personality-types?utm_campaign=intrel)

A [psychology reading](https://opensource.com/open-organization/18/11/design-communities-personality-types?utm_campaign=intrel)! I used to love psychology when I was younger. I used to look through my sister's textbooks and pretend I knew what was going on.

Also speaking of personality types, I am [INFP-T](https://www.16personalities.com/infp-personality). Do what you want with that information...

I agree with the general idea behind the article. It is a common saying that people do not quit their jobs but on their management team instead. So it was endearing to hear the author say, "... if you're hoping to lead a successful open source project, don't spend all your resources on the _product_. Care for your people, and your people will help you with the rest of it."

Though I appreciate the efforts to make a work place more comfortable for all personalities, I think it's important to not view employees as just these categories. People react to their environments and, in some circumstances, may respond differently then expected. Sometimes people get stuck in certain mannerisms or feel like they don't reflect what they feel/see inside themselves. Some people are looking to change others may be looking to be understood. It's important to talk to your peers and understand how they would respond to other environments.

## [25 Years Later: Interview with Linus Torvalds](https://www.linuxjournal.com/content/25-years-later-interview-linus-torvalds)

First of all... I'm only twenty two... so.... wow.  
Linux has and always will continue to be around longer than I have or ever will be.

What I love most about this interview Linus' reponses to some of these questions.  
When asked about his joke about planning to take over the world Linus responds with:

> Well, I stopped doing the "world domination" joke long ago, because it seemed to become less of a joke as time went on. But it always was a joke, and it wasn't why I (or any of the other developers) really did what we did anyway. It was always about just making better technology and having interesting challenges.
>
> And none of that has really changed on a core level. All the details have changed—the hardware is very different, the problems we have are very different, and my role is very different. But the whole "make it better and have interesting challenges" is all the same.

I love this quote in particular because this is how I fell in love with programming and computer science in general. I always looked forward to making something better and overcoming the challenges along the way.

And none of that has really changed on a core level. All the details have changed—the hardware is very different, the problems we have are very different, and my role is very different. But the whole "make it better and have interesting challenges" is all the same.

I loved the rant on privacy versus anonymity.
