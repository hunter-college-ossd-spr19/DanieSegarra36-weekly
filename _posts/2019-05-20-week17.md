## Reflection

This class has contributed greatly to my life. Transparency, honesty, and openness are a few qualities I've always treasured. Finding a community that embraces these qualities as its defining characteristics has made me feel more comfortable and at home in this ever changing field.

Quite often I feel like an outsider due to my lack of experience in this field (two years of computer science study). Nonetheless I understand that this does not define me. My passion for creating and helping others. Finding a community that focused more on how the people can collaborate in order to accomplish a task really sold me. I felt like I was being viewed as a human looking to solve problems with other humans as opposed to a software engineer being used for profit.

This class has opened my eyes and I will continue to try and influence others as positively as open source has.

## Contributions

My [PR](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35871) to Free Code Camp on customizing Visual Studio Code was merged! This is one of my favorite tips as it really speeds up my workflow.

My other [PR](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/freeCodeCamp/pull/35974) on customizing the command prompt on macOS is still being reviewed.

### Wikipedia

Over the last few week I've been updating the Game of Thrones (A Song of Ice and Fire Franchise) [page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Outline_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_franchise) updated. As new episodes aired from the final season, I updated the list of episodes.  
My original idea was to add images to all the episodes, as a UX decision for the mobile app view. The about image is the first image you see and takes up the entire screen width. Having an image here brightens up the mobile experience but only original images can be uploaded. Since I do not own the any stills from the HBO series, I cannot upload an image.
