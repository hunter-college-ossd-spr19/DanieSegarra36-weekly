### Personal Updates

Todays marks the first week of a new journey and my last, first week of a semester as an undergraduate. In other words... I'm graduating at the end of this semester!

### In Class Activities/Takeaways

On January 29, 2019, for our [first in class assignment](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/activities/openstreetmap_editing.pdf), we did some [OpenStreetMap](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenStreetMap) edits.  
Mine can be found [here](https://www.openstreetmap.org/user/DanielMateo/history).

Brooklyn has been changing a lot and my area tends to have a few missing or out of date information on locations.

### Open Source vs Free Software

[Free software](https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html) is the idea of having the freedom to do whatever you want with said software. This includes: "the rights to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software."

[Open source software](https://opensource.org/osd) defines the transparency of the software as well as the terms of usage and distribution.

Some key points:

- open software can be incorporated into closed/proprietary software.
- allows for redistribution without requiring royalties (if sold)
- modifications of the software must be released under the same license agreements
- no discrimination towards any parties or fields
