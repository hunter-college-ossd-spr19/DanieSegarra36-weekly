### [Merging and Rebasing](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/git_merge_rebase.html#1)

Rebasing is BAD.

### [Collaborating Workflows](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/slides/collaborating_workflows.html#3)

Pulling is BAD.

I almost never use`git fetch` and almost exclusively `pull` because it's never been much of an issue with my projects (either solo or small team). I do believe I should get into the habit of strictly fetching, as it would be an issue in larger and/or more widely distributed projects.

### Wikipedia

Unnecessary backstory incoming...

So, for some reason, I always wake up at around 3:30-4:30 a.m. EST (i don't know why, i just snap up).  
This time, I stayed up reading Game of Thrones stuff, due to my thoughts on the recently aired episode, [The Long Night](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Long_Night_(Game_of_Thrones_episode)>). While reading, I ended up on the wiki page for the timeline of the Song of Ice and Fire franchise and noticed that the episodes for season seven and eight were not present. I, therefore, took it upon myself to [add them](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Outline_of_A_Song_of_Ice_and_Fire_franchise&action=history)!
