Project Evaluation :  
Your assignment is to use the guidance document, [Project Evaluation Guidance](compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/course_materials/csci395.86/activities/project_evaluation_activity.pdf) to evaluate the following three projects:

- [OpenFoodFacts Server](github.com/openfoodfacts/openfoodfacts-server)
- [Netflix Conductor](github.com/Netflix/conductor)
- [DOxygen](github.com/doxygen/doxygen)

Everyone has been given a repository in which to do this assignment. Your repository is named GitHub-account-name-project-evaluation-01, where GitHub-account-name is to be replaced by your actual GitHub username.

What things do you feel you need to learn the most to be able to contribute to open source projects? What are the weak points that you want to strengthen?
