## What am I looking at?

Hello! My name is [Daniel Segarra](https://github.com/hunter-college-ossd-spr19/DanieSegarra36-weekly/blob/gh-pages/about.md) and you are witnessing my academic journey.  
This repository is intended for me to [document my weekly progress](https://hunter-college-ossd-spr19.github.io/DanieSegarra36-weekly/), as I delve deeper into the world of open source software ([OOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)).  
At times, I may sound and appear misinformed and like a complete novice and that would be because I definitely am just that.  
Exploring this new territory [OOS] and tackling it's obstacles will strengthen my understanding and allow me to become a strong and reputable contributor.

I will be building these new skills with the guidance of my professor, [Stewart Weiss](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/), and the companionship of my equally as eager classmates.
