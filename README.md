## What am I looking at?
Hello! My name is [Daniel Segarra](https://github.com/hunter-college-cs-ossd/DanieSegarra36-weekly/blob/master/about.md) and you are witnessing my academic journey.  
This repository is intended for me to [document my weekly progress](https://github.com/hunter-college-cs-ossd/DanieSegarra36-weekly/tree/master/_posts), as I delve deeper into the world of open source software ([OOS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software)).  
At times, I may sound and appear misinformed and like a complete novice and that would be because I definitely am just that.  
Exploring this new territory [OOS] and tackling it's obstacles will strengthen my understanding and allow me to become a strong and reputable contributor.

# About Your Jekyll-based Blog Hosted on GitHub Pages

Jekyll is a simple, open-source, blog-aware, static site generator.
Jekyll is the engine behind GitHub Pages, so you can host your 
Jekyll blog on GitHubâ€™s servers for free. The difficult work has
already been done for you; all you have to do is some simple
user-specific tinkering in the repository that has been created for
you.

# Instructions For Setting Up Your Weekly Blog Repository

Follow the steps below in order to set up your weekly blog.

1. Locate your repository in the class organization; 
it is named *YOUR_ID*-weekly, where *YOUR_ID* is the GitHub user name that you
chose for yourself. 

2. Click on the repository icon to open it.

    
6. Edit the `_config.yml` file and follow the instructions in the comments in that file.

7. Edit the `about.md` file to include some information about yourself. Since the
blog posts and this file are public, everyone can see what you put there, so 
give some thought to what you would like to say.
In any case, make sure that you use *Markdown* to format this page. 

8. After you have completed all of the steps above, modify this `README.md` file
so that it contains a short description of your repository. 
You will not need to keep these instructions in this file, since they 
are replicated in the file INSTRUCTIONS.md contained in this repository. 
As an idea, it could be something like this:

> This repository belongs to ... and contains weekly blogs written by ...
> for a course in Open Source software development.

I will be building these new skills with the guidance of my professor, [Stewart Weiss](http://www.compsci.hunter.cuny.edu/~sweiss/), and the companionship of my equally as eager classmates.
